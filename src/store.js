// Small persistence under /data (the only writable path of the container): the
// units seen so far, with their address, their generation of encryption and
// the key each one gave at binding, so a restart talks to them at once,
// without a new scan or a new binding. Losing the file is harmless: the next
// scan finds the units and binds them again.
//
// The keys only open the local protocol of the units: the file is still
// written for the container's user alone (mode 600), and never logged.
